# Major-Project
The motivation for this project came from the countries where economy is based on agricultureand the climatic conditions lead to lack of rains & scarcity of water. Our country mostly depends on agriculture. The farmers working in the farm lands are solely dependent on therains and bore wells for irrigation of the land. Even if the farm land has a water-pump, manual intervention by farmers is required to turn the pump on/off whenever needed. The project aim is to detect the dryness in soil using sensors and provide water to the plant appropriately. This project helps to maintain the plants quite easily. In this project we are detecting soil moisture and need for Irrigation. The Aim of our project is to minimize this manual intervention by the farmer. Automated Irrigation system will serve the following purposes:
1) As there is no un-planned usage of water, a lot of water is saved from being wasted.
2) The irrigation is done only when there is not enough moisture in the soil and the sensors decide when the pump should be turned on/off. This saves a lot time for the farmers. This also gives much needed rest to the farmers, as they donâ€™t have to go and turn the pump on/off manually.
